        <h2>🏙️ Cities That Shape Colombia</h2>

        <div class="city">
            <h3>🌄 Medellín – The City of Eternal Spring</h3>
            <img src="IMG_7762.jpg" alt="Medellín City" style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px;">

        </div>

        <div class="city">
            <h3>🏙️ Bogotá – The Heart of the Country</h3>
            <p>The capital. A chaotic symphony of people, politics, culture, and creativity. Bogotá sits high in the Andes and pulses with diversity from every corner of Colombia.</p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="city">
            <h3>🌊 Barranquilla – Where the Party Never Stops</h3>
            <p>Barranquilla is rhythm, color, and joy — the birthplace of Shakira and the home of Colombia’s second-largest carnival. This Caribbean city is bold, warm, and full of flavor.</p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="city">
            <h3>🔥 Cali – The Capital of Salsa</h3>
            <p>Cali is movement — from the salsa that pulses through its streets to the boldness of its people. It’s one of Colombia’s most culturally rich and ethnically diverse cities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vibe:</strong> Passionate, soulful, rebellious.</li>
                <li><strong>Must-experience:</strong> A salsa class, San Antonio neighborhood, and the iconic Cristo Rey.</li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>🍲 Our Food – Flavors That Tell a Story</h2>
        <p>If you really want to understand Colombia, start with the food. Colombian cuisine is a reflection of our diversity — a mix of Indigenous, African, Spanish, and Arab influences, shaped by geography and tradition.</p>

        <div class="food">
            <h3>🥘 Bandeja Paisa (Antioquia)</h3>
            <p>A legendary dish from the coffee region. It’s hearty, indulgent, and deeply symbolic of Paisa culture.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What’s in it?</strong> Red beans, white rice, ground beef, chicharrón, fried egg, plantain, arepa, chorizo, avocado, and sometimes a slice of blood sausage.</li>
                <li><strong>How it feels:</strong> Like a hug from your abuela after a long day.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🍲 Ajiaco (Bogotá and the Andes)</h3>
            <p>A warm, comforting chicken and potato soup made with three kinds of potatoes and flavored with guasca leaves. Served with avocado, rice, and capers.</p>
            <p><strong>When to eat it?</strong> On a rainy Bogotá afternoon — or any time you need comfort in a bowl.</p>

            <h3>🌮 Arepas (Everywhere, but different everywhere)</h3>
            <p>Arepas are corn-based patties eaten throughout Colombia — but they vary wildly by region.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Antioquia:</strong> Thin and grilled.</li>
                <li><strong>Caribbean Coast:</strong> Stuffed with cheese, eggs, or meat.</li>
                <li><strong>Santander:</strong> Crunchy and made with corn and pork bits.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Arepas are like Colombians themselves — simple, adaptable, and full of character.</strong></p>

            <h3>🍌 Sancocho (National dish)</h3>
            <p>This beloved stew is cooked differently across regions, but always with yuca, plantain, corn, and meat (chicken, fish, beef, or pork).</p>
            <p><strong>It’s best shared</strong> — sancocho is a dish for family gatherings, birthdays, or a lazy Sunday in the countryside.</p>

            <h3>🧁 Postres (Desserts)</h3>
            <p>Colombians love sweet things! Some of our most cherished desserts include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arequipe:</strong> Our version of dulce de leche.</li>
                <li><strong>Obleas:</strong> Thin wafers filled with arequipe, cheese, and jam.</li>
                <li><strong>Brevas con arequipe:</strong> Figs with caramel.</li>
                <li><strong>Natilla y buñuelos:</strong> Traditional Christmas treats that bring the whole family together.</li>
            </ul>
