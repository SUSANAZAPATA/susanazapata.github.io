 Welcome to The Real Colombia! 🇨🇴 

 Hello and welcome to my blog.

I am Susana Zapata Arango, a Colombian dietitian and digital media enthusiast currently living in Australia. After years of living abroad and answering countless questions like “Is Colombia really like in the movies?” or “What’s it actually like to grow up there?”, I felt it was time to share the truth — our truth — from the inside out.

The Real Colombia is a space dedicated to celebrating, exploring, and revealing the Colombia that many people never get to see. Yes, we have breathtaking landscapes and vibrant cities — but we’re also a country full of contrasts, colors, and complexity. We are more than coffee and clichés. We are a diverse nation with deep-rooted traditions, creative communities, incredible cuisine, and stories that deserve to be told in our own words.

On this blog, I will take you on a journey through:

🌆 Our cities: modern, historic, chaotic, and full of life.

🍲 Our food: from humble street snacks to traditional dishes passed down through generations.

🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏽 Our people: a mosaic of ethnicities, cultures, and identities that make Colombia unique.

✨ Our traditions: like La Noche de las Velitas (Candle Night in December), our joyful and colorful Christmas celebrations, and many more local customs that bring communities together.

🧠 Our current reality: the good, the bad, and everything in between. 

This is not a tourism blog, this is a truth blog. It is a space to reflect, connect, and hopefully inspire more understanding and appreciation for a country that is often misunderstood.

If you are Colombian and living abroad, I hope this feels like home. If you have never been to Colombia but want to learn more, I am glad you are here. And if you are somewhere in between: curious, open-minded, ready to listen, then bienvenido (Welcome)!

Thank you for stopping by.
Get ready to experience Colombia as it really is: raw, beautiful, complex, and unforgettable.

With love,

Susana.
