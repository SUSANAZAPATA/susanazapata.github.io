 From Colombia to Australia: My Journey and experience Studying & Working Abroad. 
 
 Welcome to my blog!
 
 I am Susana Zapata Arango, a dietitian and currently pursuing a master's degree in digital media.
 I would love to share my experience of moving from Colombia to Australia to study and work.

 Here, I talk about the challenges, lessons, and personal growth that come with living abroad. If you are thinking about studying or working in a new country, I hope my journey inspires and helps you!

 Stay tuned for new posts, tips and reflections!
